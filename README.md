# CCheckpoints

A checkpoint system for Claude Code CLI that automatically tracks your coding sessions. Inspired by Cursor IDE's checkpoint feature - see everything you've done with Claude Code CLI and navigate through your conversation history.

## What is CCheckpoints?

CCheckpoints hooks into Claude Code CLI to automatically save checkpoints every time you interact with Claude Code CLI. It creates a timeline of your entire coding session that you can view in a beautiful web dashboard.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g ccheckpoints

# Run (auto-setup + open dashboard)
ccheckpoints
```

That's it! Running `ccheckpoints` will:
1. ‚úÖ Auto-setup Claude Code hooks (if not already done)
2. ‚úÖ Start the background server
3. ‚úÖ Open the dashboard in your browser

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Tracking**: Every time you send a message to Claude Code CLI, CCheckpoints saves it as a checkpoint
2. **Background Server**: Runs quietly at `http://127.0.0.1:9271` to handle tracking
3. **Web Dashboard**: Beautiful interface to see all your checkpoints and sessions
4. **SQLite Database**: All data stored locally in `%APPDATA%/CCheckpoints/`

## Commands

### Just run it!
```bash
ccheckpoints
```
This does everything - sets up hooks if needed and opens the dashboard.

### Manual setup (optional)
```bash
ccheckpoints setup
```
Only needed if you want to setup without opening the dashboard.

### Show dashboard
```bash
ccheckpoints show
```
Same as running just `ccheckpoints` - opens the dashboard (with auto-setup if needed).

### Help
```bash
ccheckpoints --help
```

### Verbose mode
```bash
ccheckpoints --verbose
```
See detailed logs of what's happening behind the scenes.

## What Gets Tracked?

- **Every message you send to Claude Code CLI** (submit event)
- **Session stops** (when you exit Claude Code)
- **Timestamps** for everything
- **Full conversation context**

## File Locations

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/CCheckpoints/`
- **Mac/Linux**: `~/.ccheckpoints/`

Contains:
- `checkpoints.db` - SQLite database with all your data
- `logs/` - Debug logs (when using --verbose)

## For Developers

### Build from source

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/p32929/ccheckpoints.git
cd ccheckpoints

# Install deps
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# install globally
npm install -g .

# Now use it
ccheckpoints
```

### Development mode

```bash
npm run dev         # Run without building
npm run dev:watch   # Auto-reload on changes
```

## How the Hook System Works

When you run `ccheckpoints setup`, it adds these hooks to your Claude Code config:

- `userPromptSubmit` ‚Üí Tracks when you send a message
- `stop` ‚Üí Tracks when session ends

The hooks call `ccheckpoints track --event=<type>` which sends the data to the background server running on port 9271.

## Troubleshooting

### Port 9271 already in use?
The background server needs port 9271. If it's busy, close other apps using it.

### Dashboard won't open?
Make sure the server is running. Try `ccheckpoints --verbose` to see what's happening.

### Hooks not working?
Run setup again:
```bash
ccheckpoints setup
```

### See detailed logs
```bash
ccheckpoints --verbose
```
Check logs in `%APPDATA%/CCheckpoints/logs/`

## Found Something?

If you find a bug or have an idea, feel free to open an issue! I'd be happy to discuss and see what we can do about it together.

Your feedback means a lot - thank you for using CCheckpoints!
